qwe.sss Introduction
qwe This is my {b/CellularPainter}, based on the same idea than the
qwe {e/SonicPainter} but applied to a Cellular Automata.

qwe.sss Automata
qwe The rules of this Automata are the same than the {e/Game of Life}.
qwe In case you don't know the {e/Game of Life}, please google for it.

qwe The space of the Cellular Automata is a torus. Opposite sides are
qwe connected to eah other: left and right, top and bottom.

qwe Ecah generation is drawn starting in a different row. This achieves
qwe the effect of {e/falling cells}.

qwe.sss Indicators
qwe Circles in blue indicate the generation speed, that is, the number
qwe of generations per second.

qwe Numbers in white indicate the generation number. Green ones, the
qwe number of alive cells.

qwe.sss Interaction
qwe Drag the mouse over the Cellular Automata and alive cells are added
qwe in the mouse position.

qwe Drag the mouse over the right side of the screen and the speed is
qwe changed.

qwe.sec Additional Work
qwe Will try to add more control over the Cellular Automata. For example,
qwe to change the number of cells (width, height), to record the history
qwe of these {e/falling cells} to compose new images, and so on.
