# CellularPainter

## Introduction

This is my *CellularPainter_, based on the same idea than the
*SonicPainter* but applied to a Cellular Automata. A demo can be seed on
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/100168098)


## Automata

The rules of this Automata are the same than the *Game of Life*. In case you
don't know what is this, please google for it.

The space of the Cellular Automata is a torus. Opposite sides are connected
to eah other: left and right, top and bottom.

Ecah generation is drawn starting in a different row. This creates the effect
of *falling cells*.


## Indicators

Circles in blue indicate the generation speed, that is, the number of
generations per second.

Numbers in white indicate the generation number. Green ones, the number of
alive cells.


## Interaction

Drag the mouse over the Cellular Automata and alive cells are added in the
mouse position.

Drag the mouse over the right side of the screen and the speed is changed.
